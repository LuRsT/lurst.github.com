        <p>Welcome! Unlike a usual blog, you won't find a list of articles sorted by
published date, but instead you'll find a collection of pages which may
relate to each other.</p>
<p>Think of this as a live wiki kind of thing, I'll try to make sure there are
links for every page created.</p>
<p>Here is a list to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/about">About me</a></li>
</ul>
    </section>
