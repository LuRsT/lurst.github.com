        <p>In the style of <a href="https://usesthis.com">The Setup</a>, this is my self-interview
about my setup.</p>
<h2 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you, and what do you do?</h2>
<p>I'm Gil, a software developer of mostly web stuff.</p>
<h2 id="what-hardware-do-you-use">What hardware do you use?</h2>
<p>I have a T440s and a X230, I love thinkpads, I use the X230 mostly for being
with me everywhere I go, the T440s is for those moments where portability is
not essential (it still is a very light and small machine).</p>
<p>I also own a custom build machine but I don't count that towards my setup since
it's basically just for gaming.</p>
<h2 id="and-what-software">And what software?</h2>
<p>I try to use cli software as much as I can, so I edit code in Vim (sometimes I
use PyCharm with the vi plugin for some projects), tmux and a console and
Firefox.</p>
<p>Most of the software I write is written with Python</p>
<h2 id="what-would-be-your-dream-setup">What would be your dream setup?</h2>
<p>A super sturdy and light laptop that could not only enable me to play games, but
to also develop, wik</p>
