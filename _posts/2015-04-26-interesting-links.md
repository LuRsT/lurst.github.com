Yesterday I had this idea that I should blog about articles that I've read,
and since I use [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) for 95% (the rest is read on
the browser) of my article reading, I decided to leverege it's API to help me do
just that.

Which resulted in [this](https://github.com/LuRsT/pocket_latest_read_articles).
It's still in development (what isn't?) but it works (for me at least), I still
need to fix some stuff, but hopefully I will be able to deploy it, so that any
human being can use it to check their latest read articles.
