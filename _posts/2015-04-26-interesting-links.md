Yesterday I had this idea that I should blog about articles that I've read,
and since I use [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) for 95% (the rest is read on
the browser) of my article reading, I decided to leverage it's API to help me do
just that.

Which resulted in [this](https://github.com/LuRsT/pocket_latest_read_articles).
It's still in development (what isn't?) but it works (for me at least), I still
need to fix some stuff, but hopefully I will be able to deploy it, so that any
human being can use it to check their latest read articles.

My motivation behind this is to both increase the amount of words I read,
inproved learning (from re-reading and summarizing those articles) and of
course, sharing them so that people can enjoy good articles.
