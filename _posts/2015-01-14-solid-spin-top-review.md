About two months ago I backed this
[kickstart project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/651785438/solidspin-spinning-tops)
without knowing anything about spinning tops, but I just got curious since
there has been a

[apparently](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/darksucks/prometheus-spins-the-lambda-top),
so I decided to back the one that I liked the most, the SolidSpin.

I haven't been able to spin it for more than 2 minutes, but I blame my
technique and the lack of any perfectly stable and clear surfaces (one
of the things that I learned from this spinning top is that no surface
is really smooth), apart from that, the item looks really well made, I
managed to accidentally remove one of the rubber rings but it was easy
to put it back. I have mixed feelings about the rubber rings, for one
they make it easy to spin it, but on the other hand they are removable
parts of the spinner, which I think should be only made out of one or
two pieces, for that reason I thought about backing the
[forever spinning top](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1251371853/forever-spinning-top)
instead of this one.

I still haven't found what to do with a spinning top yet, I've read that you
can use them as a random short timer (for example: I'll wash the dishes while
it spins), and that's my idea for using it, if you have any other idea for
things to do with it, please tell me.

The box where the spin top came was made out of cardboard and foam, not
the best packaging I've ever seen but I'm not intending on using it, so
I don't really mind it, what's important is the content.

Finally, the one I'm reviewing is the aluminium version, I actually wanted the
brass or the black edition, but I couldn't justify spending more money on
something that I'd never had before. Having said that, the aluminium looks nice,
althought it looks like scratches will be very visible since it has a very shiny
appearance, so I'll just try not to scratch it too much :). As for the weight,
it's good, althought personally, I'd prefer it to be a bit heavier, this may be
improved in the other metal versions.

I give it 4 stars out of 5
