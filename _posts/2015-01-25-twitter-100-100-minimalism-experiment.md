title: Twitter 100/100 - A minimalism experiment
layout: post
---

This weekend I had the idea to do a little minimalism experiment, I was
browsing twitter and I noticed that I had a little over 120 people I follow
and about 200 tweets (I had way more, but a few months ago I deleted most of
them with [tweetdelete.net](http://tweetdelete.net)). So I thought, why not remove them and restrict
myself to 100 tweets and 100 people I follow (followees?).

I'm not sure why I decided to do this or what I expected to get from this, but
it sure won't hurt to try, right?

I was expecting to not have any results in the begining of this experiment, but
I do have some things to report. By taking a good look at the
people/companies/organizations that I follow, I could see a pattern for the
reasons why I follow each of them, and by noticing it, I got a nice insight
into how I use twitter with the added bonus that I now have less unimportant
tweets in my timeline. By deleting some of my tweets I could also see the
pattern of my tweeting, this will enable me to improve it, I now have a better
idea of what should I tweet/retweet in order to have the content that I truly
want to have on my twitter.

In conclusion, I can say that after this first purging, I will be more mindful
when I use twitter, resulting in (probably, I don't know yet) a better
experience when I'm using twitter. For now, I will keep using this rule and
should anything change, I'll write a new post.
