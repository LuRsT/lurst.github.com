This week I read about a nice [motivation hack](http://jamesclear.com/paper-clips)
which consists of visualizing progress of good habits by moving paper clips from
one jar to another, made me think about doing something similar but digital...

I also found [this](http://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2015/04/05/your-first-choice-is-rarely-the-optimal-choice-5-lessons-on-being-wrong/)
amusing article on how we should stop worrying about whether what we're doing
is a good thing or not since making a bad decision will probably lead us to
growth.

Another good article is [this one](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/my-academic-book-in-plain-text.html)
about how this book writer prefers to use plain text for writing his books
than the typical tools that cause various different nightmares. Or, just
more reasons for using minimalistic tools.
