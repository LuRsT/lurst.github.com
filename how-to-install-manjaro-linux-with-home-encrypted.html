        <p>So, this weekend I decided to upgrade my little Asus Vivobook with my old SSD
since I want to only use one laptop, and having one laptop that I don't intend
to use for programming with an SDD and another which I do use for programming
without doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Having moved all the data around is time consuming enough, but I still had to
deal with the fact that the laptop uses a slim hard drive and my SSD wasn't very
slim at all, so I had to remove the SSD casing and plug it it, and it worked
right away!</p>
<p>But I was far from finishing the setup of my machine, I had to install Linux on
it, and this shouldn't be difficult but I wanted my /home partition to be
encrypted and that complicated everything...</p>
<p>I won't bother you with the details of my many installations until I got it
