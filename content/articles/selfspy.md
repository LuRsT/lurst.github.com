The [Selfspy](https://github.com/gurgeh/selfspy) project looks like a nice way to spy on yourself in order to get a good insight on what exactly are you doing with your time, it's something that if I wasn't so paranoid myself, and if I didn't have so many devices, I'd try it. 

Maybe when I can live with only one laptop, I'll check it out.
